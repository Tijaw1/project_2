### **Project Description**

- Utilizing historical data of borrowers, weâ€™re going to use (XYZ Model) to predict the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.

### **Objectives / Project Questions to Answer**
- Identify important features 
- What is the best model(s) to try and predict this type of outcome?
- Is there correlation to Age, Monthly Income, Number of Open Credit Lines/Loans, Real Estate Lines/Loans, and Number of Dependents?

### **Data Sources**
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit/data)
